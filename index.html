        <br>

        <p>Dropped down the lights, I'm sitting with you <br>
            Moscow, 1972 <br>
        </p>

        <p>Always singing in my sleep <br>
            I will leave it in my dreams <br>
        </p>

        <p>Oh, making bad decisions <br>
            Oh, making bad decisions <br>
            Making bad decisions for you <br>
            Oh, making bad decisions <br>
            Uh-oh, making bad decisions <br>
            I'm making bad decisions for you <br>
        </p>

        <p>Pick up your gun <br>
            Put up those gloves <br>
            Save us from harm <br>
            Safe or alone <br>
        </p>

        <p>Oh, baby, I hang on everything you say <br>
            I wanna write down every word <br>
            But do me a favor when you come close <br>
            When I look around, don't wanna see you <br>
            I don't take advice from fools <br>
            Never listening to you <br>
        </p>

      <p>Oh, making bad decisions <br>
            Oh, making bad decisions <br>
            Making bad decisions for you <br>
            Oh, making bad decisions <br>
            Uh-oh, making bad decisions <br>
            I'm making bad decisions for you <br>
        </p>
    
        <p>Pick up your gun <br>
            Put up those gloves <br>
            Save us from harm <br>
            Safe or alone <br>
        </p>

        <p>You, you didn't listen to me <br>
            But I, I didn't listen to you <br>
        </p>

        <p>I waited so long <br>
            Listening for <br>
            Something to work <br>
        </p>

        <p>I'm making bad decisions <br>
            Really, really bad decisions <br>
            I'm making bad decisions <br>
            On you, on you <br>
            Yeah, yeah <br>
            Yeah, yeah <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
            I'm not gonna give a lot of credit <br>
            I don't how to use how <br>
            'Cause I can't, I can't <br>
            I can't, can't make anymore <br>
